Annie and Solo worked on the framework of the website this week/10.31~11.7, what we did are listed below:
1. We decid to use the Amap for the API (Amap in Chinese is ¸ßµÂµØÍ¼). In the beginning, we compared four maps (only for API): Google Map, Baidu Map, Tencent Map and Amap. 
Honestly, Google Map performs best, but it's hard to use Google services in mainland China, therefore, we abandoned the Google Map. 
Baidu Map doesn't have English Map for API and its internal code is complex and inefficient. Tencent map API development is more like at a begining stage with few internal functions.
In contrast, Amap's API is more suitable for developers, it opens a lot of functions, the code programmability is much better than Baidu map(we did try it), and support English Map. That's why we chose Amap.
2. Based on Amap, the language transformation of the map is implemented.
3. The ability to make the map scalable is implemented.
4. The map center was located in ningbo and it can be dragged and zoomed.
5. The first point/coordinate on the map was marked.
6. A simple toolbar and navigation bar were made.

What we are going to implement next:
1. A functional toolbar and navigation.
2. Attach attributes to the marker to make it a button.
3. A window to play video.
