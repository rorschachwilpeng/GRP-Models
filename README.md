Building the simulation models for the GRP


2020/1/13
The Simulation Of The Road Traffic:
1. Target the road at the crossroads on the InCity;
2. Build the basic road and the cars model;


2020/1/22

The basic version of Road Traffic Simulation is done:

The Work Done:
1. Drawing the basic map by editing the GaoDe map's Satellite map.

2. Drawing the road

3. Building the 3D version 

4. Building the logic for the cars and the traffic light


The Work Should Continue:
1. Adding the Bus station

2. May adding Electric vehicle ? 

3. Add the frame which can junmp immediately from the logic to the logic/3D


The Work needed invastigate:

1. The probability of turnaround , turn right , turn left , Going stright

2. The location of bus station

3. The time period of the traffic light


2020/2/6/

The work done on 2020.2.6

1. Make adjustment to the veiw of the model -> now can junmp to different versions during the simulation


The work done on 2020.2.22

1. Fix the size problem, all page got same size when running the model; 

2. The problem with the zoom out and zoom in which can't make the page stable is still need to be fixed


2020.2.23
1. Draw done all the polyline (所有的折线都画在了图上 -> 用于清晰分辨商店）
2. Draw all the entrances (consumer现在可以进入所有的 商店）
3. 3D vision 
4. 导航栏加入

The work still need to do next还没完成的工作：
1.  加每个商店人数 counter
2. 加摄像头机位
3. 商场工作人员
4. 加小障碍物
