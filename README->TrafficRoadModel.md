Building the simulation models for the GRP

2020/1/13
The Simulation Of The Road Traffic:
1. Target the road at the crossroads on the InCity;
2. Build the basic road and the cars model;


2020/1/22
The basic version of Road Traffic Simulation is done:

The Work Done:
1. Drawing the basic map by editing the GaoDe map's Satellite map.
2. Drawing the road
3. Building the 3D version 
4. Building the logic for the cars and the traffic light


The Work Should Continue:
1. Adding the Bus station
2. May adding Electric vehicle ? 
3. Add the frame which can junmp immediately from the logic to the logic/3D


The Work needed invastigate:
1. The probability of turnaround , turn right , turn left , Going stright
2. The location of bus station
3. The time period of the traffic light


The work still need to do next还没完成的工作：
1. 需要收集公交车站数据: 公交车站具体位置，公交车站的来去频率，公交车站的车次
2. 需要收集自行车与电动车的数据：电动车和自行车的大致数量统计（单位时间内）
3. 红绿灯的时长
4. 可调头车道的范围
